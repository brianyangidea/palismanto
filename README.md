A card battling game with no theme!

Ever played a card battler that was fun, but got annoyed that they only stuck with some boring old theme? Like wizards? Or zombies? Or wizard zombies?

Well, you're in luck my friendly chucklenut!

Introducing **_Plalismanto_**! The card battling game with no theme whatsoever! All the good stuff with card battlers is here, but the cards and mechanics are just whatever I think is cool. Have fun! ðŸ˜œ
